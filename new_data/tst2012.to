Yeah, I did wonder about that but I couldn't bring myself to think Deirdre would be that mercenary!  I mean it's one thing not bowing out but she's actually spoken publicly about it arguing his innocence.  Her reputation is on the line surely?

[](/seriouslyupset-r) There is nothing wrong with changing. In fact, I hope you continue to do so. As long as you remember that you are a pony.
Maybe we get there by criticizing the inappropriate reactions.  :P
