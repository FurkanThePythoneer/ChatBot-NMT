The fire escape is there. You hear wood splintering, and look to see that a raptor has managed to break a hole in the top of the door, just above the dresser. Its head pokes through, then disappears. There's another thud, and the dresser moves forward a few inches.

I physically cringed at 'creamy thighs.'
I need new Japanese music to listen to recommend me something. Also today I saw some real life zettai ryouiki it was great. 
Evidence is racist!
It's kind of hilarious because all of the racist submissions get taken down in like four seconds, but they keep trying anyway. Silly racists.

Maybe you're right.  Didn't mean to come off with hostility.

Welp, those bastards over at /r/AustinGuns have almost burned through 200 rounds of M2 ball in a month. Bring more if you come out. Still waiting on my next CMP delivery.

I get what you're saying, though. It's going to be great to get to a point in the culture where we can just say 'Oh, you like dudes? Cool.' :) We'll get there eventually.
Thank God.  We should be grateful.
Oh for sure. I can definitely see CZW doing that.. and then someone being impaled in one of the bamboo.. things.. or whatever the hell they were, what were they? Jesus
